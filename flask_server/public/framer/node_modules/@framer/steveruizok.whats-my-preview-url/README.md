# What's my preview URL?

Want to open your project in a regular web browser? Drop this component into your project and get the URL as a link. Nice!

# You donâ€™t really need this component

Framer uses a standard URL scheme for previews. It works like this:

- If you have only one Framer project open, then the project's preview will be available at `localhost:4567`. You can type this URL into any browser and see your preview there.
- If you then open a _second_ project, then _that_ project will be available at `localhost:4568`.
- The third would be at `localhost:4569` and so on for other projects.
